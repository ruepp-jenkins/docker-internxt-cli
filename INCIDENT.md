# General

This is the original content which was written during the project was disabled. The main reason for archiving the project was, that I bought an lifetime access with CLI on the StackSocial platform. After some months the InternXT changed the StackSocial page that it is not included and removed it from those who already bought the product. As I gained the CLI access back I continue to build this project.

Way I got it back:

1. Contacted InternXT support - no response
2. Contacted StackSocial support - response but they told me that I need to deal with it, no interest in the customer, never buy something again
3. Created an InternXT CLI Github issue - immediately got some information from another user with the same problem, luckily one of the developers escalated it to the support team
4. After weeks of waiting I got a final mail about CLI was enabled again for me

Thx to the support agent who was very nice and kept me up to date of the current process.

# Original README.md text

## Attention - no newer images!

I love to build docker images especially if I want to use them for myselfe. Recently I tried to use the WebDav again and it was simply no longer working. After a search I got the info that they removed it from the StackSocial plan and added there also an information now that it is no longer included.

For me the WebDav feature was the purely function I wanted and why I bought it. So I tried to talk to InternXT (no response to my mails) and to StackSocial which told me that the seller changed it and now I need to stick to the new situation. For me I really do not like how InternXT is developing and that they shutdown features after you bought it. Also I was surprised that it felt like having no value to StackSocial as paying customer.

So I hope you understand my decision to shutdown this image building service as it is no longer useful to me and consumes some money to build the images for all different architectures.
